git actions 
and proper git actions automation to automaintain library
we want a git action which should run with npm token and it should be 100% proper so that release can happen with creating tag in git itself

next change we want is our username 
we have said user name is rakshit-patel but it should be rakshitbharat
also auther name is Rakshit Patel so no problem for that
